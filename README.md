# BitfountainDownloader
A utility for automatically backing up videos from your Bitfountain library.

__Please use only for your own personal library__. Bitfountain is an amazing service run by dedicated instructors that work hard to bring us great educational content. They regularly spend the time and effort to update their videos and other material and the comments section and accessability of the instructors is worth the price of admission.

## To run
Create a virtualenv, activate and pip install beautifulsoup4

Run the script like so:
python main.py <email> <password> <course alias> <simulate>[optional]

For course alias, use "iOS8", "AppleWatch" or "FlappyBird"

To just simulate the download, set the simulate option to "True" or omit to run for real.
